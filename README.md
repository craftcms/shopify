Webhooks
While in development we recommend using the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tool to create a tunnel to your local development environment. This will allow Shopify to send webhooks to your local environment.
Once you are in production you will need to generate the webhooks for that environment and can delete your ngrok if you want.

Product Element

The Product element type represents a product in your Shopify store.
All products are created, updated, and deleted via the Shopify control panel, and are reflected in Craft.

## Syncing Products

Products will be created, updated, and deleted automatically via the webhooks.

If you want to sync all Products you can do so by running the following console command:

    php craft shopify/sync/product
